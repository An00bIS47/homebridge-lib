## Utility Library for Homebridge Plugins
Copyright Â© 2017,2018 Erik Baauw. All rights reserved.

While developing a number of [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugins, I find myself duplicating a lot of code.  The idea behind this utility library is to ease developing and maintaining homebridge plugins by separating this generic code, dealing with [HomeKit](http://www.apple.com/ios/home/) and homebridge, from the specific code, dealing with the actual devices being exposed to HomeKit.

The homebridge-lib library provides the following functionality:
- Saving and restoring accessories from persistent storage between homebridge sessions (using the homebridge v2 dynamic platform model);
- Universal Plug & Play (UPnP) device discovery;
- Setting up a heartbeat for device polling;
- Logging and error handling;
- Defining custom HomeKit services and characteristics;
- Checking the NodeJS and homebridge versions used;
- Checking the latest plugin version published to the NPM registry;
- Utility functions for: JSON formatting, calling a REST API, parsing config.json.

Technically, the homebridge-lib library is based on the following:
- Using asynchronous functions rather than callback functions;
- Using javascript classes rather than prototypes.  An actual plugin extends the classes provided by homebridge-lib;
- Using events.  In fact all homebridge-lib classes extend `EventEmitter`;

The homebridge-lib library provides a number of abstract superclasses, that act as delegate for HomeKit accessories, services, and characteristics.  A homebridge plugin based on homebridge-lib extends these classes, providing the device-specific logic.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-lib/wiki) for more information.  See [homebridge-ws](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-ws) as an example plugin based on homebridge-lib.

## Installation
This library is _not_ a homebridge plugin and should not be installed manually.  Instead, homebridge plugins using this library should list it as a dependency in their `package.json`.  This way, `npm` installs homebridge-lib automatically when installing the actual plugin.
